# Random_Walk_MonteCarlo
In this project I use the Monte Carlo simulation to solve the random walk problem.  Random Walk Problem: suppose you live in a grid and you take a random walk selecting a random direction at each grid point (back tracking permitted). What is the longest random walk you can take so that on average you end up 4 blocks or fewer from your starting point?
